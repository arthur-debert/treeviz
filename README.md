# 3viz, a terminal ast vizualizer for document based ASTs

3viz is designed to simplify reasing about document tree. The 1-line per node and colunar layout makes
scanning and grokking structure easy, while the texttual represntations, icons and extra give
additional informattion at a glance.

Being line based, it makes diffing trees useful and can be invaluable in debugging these parse trees.

This is a sample output:
