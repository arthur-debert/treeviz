# 3viz, a terminal AST visualizer for document trees

3viz is designed to simplify reasoning about document trees. The one-line-per-node and columnar layout makes scanning and understanding structure easy, while the textual representations, icons and metadata provide additional information at a glance.

Being line-based, it makes diffing trees useful and can be invaluable in debugging parse trees.

This is a sample output:

## Installing

3viz is available on PyPI as treeviz-py, and can be installed with your preferred Python package manager:

```bash
$ pipx install treeviz-py  # recommended for global availability
```

## Using 3viz

3viz can be used as a CLI:

```bash
$ 3viz <tree_path> <tree_format>
```

Or as a library:

```python
from treeviz import generate_viz

# Both document and format can be a path to a file, strings, or Python objects
generate_viz(document, format)
```
