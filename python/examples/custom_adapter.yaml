# Custom Adapter Definition Example
# This file demonstrates all the ways to customize icons in treeviz

# Basic field mappings
label: name          # Where to find the display text
type: kind           # Where to find the node type
children: children   # Where to find child nodes

# Icon customization - map node types to Unicode symbols
icons:

# Type-specific overrides
# Use different fields for different node types
type_overrides:
  # For code blocks, use the language field as the label
  code:
    label: language
    
  # For error nodes, use the message field
  error:
    label: error_message
    
  # For data files, show the format
  data:
    label: format
    
  # For git commits, show the commit message
  commit:
    label: message
    # And include author info in extra
    extra:
      author: committer

# Icon packs - define reusable sets of icons
# (Note: This is for documentation; actual icon packs are registered in code)
