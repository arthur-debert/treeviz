# Markdown Abstract Syntax Tree (mdast) adapter definition
# Defines how to render markdown AST nodes in treeviz format
# Based on the mdast specification: https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast

# Field mappings for extracting data from mdast nodes
label: value        # Extract node content from 'value' field
type: type          # Extract node type from 'type' field  
children: children  # Extract child nodes from 'children' field

# Icon mappings for different markdown node types
icons:
  root: "⧉"              # Document root
  paragraph: "¶"          # Text paragraphs
  text: "◦"              # Raw text nodes
  heading: "⊤"            # Headings (h1-h6)
  list: "☰"              # Lists (ordered/unordered)
  listItem: "•"           # Individual list items
  strong: "𝐁"            # Bold/strong text
  emphasis: "𝐼"           # Italic/emphasized text
  inlineCode: "ƒ"         # Inline code spans
  code: "𝒱"              # Code blocks
  blockquote: "❝"         # Quote blocks
  link: "🔗"             # Links
  image: "🖼"            # Images
  thematicBreak: "⸺"      # Horizontal rules/breaks

# Type-specific field overrides
# Used when different node types need different field mappings
type_overrides: {}

# Node types to ignore during rendering
