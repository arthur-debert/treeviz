3viz Exception Classes

This module contains all custom exception classes used throughout the 3viz library.
Separating exceptions prevents circular import issues between modules.

Note: We prefer to let standard Python exceptions (FileNotFoundError, ValueError, 
KeyError, etc.) bubble up naturally rather than wrapping them in custom exceptions.
This makes debugging easier and more intuitive.
