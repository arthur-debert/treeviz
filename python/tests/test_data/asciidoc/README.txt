The asciidoc files in this directory were sourced from the `opendevise/asciidoc-samples` GitHub repository, which provides a collection of AsciiDoc source files for testing purposes.

The XML files were generated by running the `asciidoc3` command-line tool to convert the `.adoc` files to the DocBook format. These XML files serve as the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for the corresponding source documents.

The `hard-line-breaks.adoc` file could not be converted due to a syntax error ("illegal style name: %hardbreaks") with the `asciidoc3` parser. This file is kept to test the adapter's ability to handle parsing failures gracefully. The `demo.adoc` file produced a warning for a missing include file, which is expected as the included file was not downloaded.
