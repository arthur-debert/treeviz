(View the source of this document to see how the hard line breaks are being cont
rolled).

By default, newlines between consecutive lines in prose (i.e., paragraph text) a
re not preserved. They are treated as a single space, just like in HTML.

first line
second line
third line

If you want newlines to be preserved as hard line breaks, you can add the `hardb
reaks` option to the paragraph.

[%hardbreaks]
first line
second line
third line

If you want to set this option globally, define the `hardbreaks` attribute in th
e document header (but know what you are doing).

A third option is to add explicit hard line breaks in the source by adding a spa
ce followed by a plus to the end of the line.

first line +
second line +
third line

Newlines are always preserved in preformatted blocks, such as a literal paragrap
h, literal block, or listing block.
