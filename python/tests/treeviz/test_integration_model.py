"""
Integration tests for the 3viz data model.

NOTE: The unit tests for the Node model have been moved to:
test__node_model.py

This file is reserved for integration tests that test the Node model
in combination with other components of the system (e.g., with adapt_node,
rendering, etc.).

Currently, there are no integration tests for the Node model as the
existing tests are focused on Node creation and properties in isolation.

# This file intentionally left mostly empty as the Node model unit
# tests have been moved to a dedicated unit test file.
