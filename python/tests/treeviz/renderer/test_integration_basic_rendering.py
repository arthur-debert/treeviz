"""
Integration tests for basic rendering functionality.

NOTE: The unit tests for the render function have been moved to:
test__renderer_basic.py

This file is reserved for integration tests that test rendering
in combination with other components of the system (e.g., complete
workflows from parsing to rendering).

Currently, there are no integration tests for basic rendering as the
existing tests focused on the render function in isolation.

# This file intentionally left mostly empty as the render function
# unit tests have been moved to a dedicated unit test file.
