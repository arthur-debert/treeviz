"""
Integration tests for indentation functionality.

NOTE: The unit tests for indentation functionality have been moved to:
test__renderer_indentation.py

This file is reserved for integration tests that test indentation
in combination with other components of the system.

Currently, there are no integration tests for indentation as the
existing tests focused on indentation behavior in isolation.

# This file intentionally left mostly empty as the indentation
# unit tests have been moved to a dedicated unit test file.
