"""
Integration tests for path parser robustness.

NOTE: The unit tests for the path expression parser have been moved to:
test__path_parser.py

This file is reserved for integration tests that test the path parser
in combination with other components of the system.

Currently, there are no integration tests for the path parser as it
is a standalone component with no external dependencies.
"""

# This file intentionally left mostly empty as the path parser is a
# standalone unit with comprehensive unit test coverage.
